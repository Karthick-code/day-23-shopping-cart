this files belongs to karthick
it includes
    => app.js
    => all components are stored in components file

the given files is converted into react components and the Add to cart is changed to Remove from cart when the button is clicked and also cart value changes respect to number of products added to cart.

!important: there was a mistake from my side that is in deployment instead of "ADD TO CART" i have given it as "ADD FROM CART". This was noticed by myself only after submission.
